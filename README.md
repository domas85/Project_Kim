# **Project Kim** - **And the Secret of the Burger Zombies**

From the Artificial Intelligence course at Futuregames

We were provided with a project and tasked to make Kim move toward burgers with Dijkstras algorithm or A* while avoiding zombies and after collecting all the burgers then move to the portal. 
Kim had to use a State machine or a Behaviour tree. There are 3 levels. 
The first 2 are not that difficult for Kim to maneuver since there are only 2 - 3 zombies, but the last level is the most difficult it has 5 zombies with minimal space between them and the buildings. 
And this is my code for the completed assignment. 

- From my limited testing I got ~70% survival rate.
